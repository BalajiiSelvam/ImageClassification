# ImageIQ : A platform for classifying Images

ðŸ“Œ Website Features:
á¯“â˜… Upload any image directly to the platform.
á¯“â˜… Classifies the image into categories like airplane, cat, truck, etc., using a trained CIFAR-10 model.
á¯“â˜… Provides top-5 predictions with confidence scores in percentage.
á¯“â˜… Detects and visualizes SIFT key-points on the uploaded image for deeper insights.
á¯“â˜… User-friendly interface with real-time results.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies & Algorithms Used:
á¯“â˜… Deep Learning Model: A trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on CIFAR-10 dataset.
á¯“â˜… Key-point Detection: Used SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for detecting image features.
á¯“â˜… Frameworks:
 âžº Flask for backend web development.
 âžº TensorFlow for loading and predicting with the model.
 âžº OpenCV for image processing and feature detection.

ðŸ“Œ Model Performance:
á¯“â˜… Accuracy: Achieved 85% on CIFAR-10 dataset during training and evaluation.
á¯“â˜… The model provides reliable predictions for multiple categories.
